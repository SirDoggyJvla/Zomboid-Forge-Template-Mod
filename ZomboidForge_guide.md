# Zomboid-Forge
This guide is dedicated to the mod Zomboid Forge which is a framework that I created to easily add custom zombies to the game while still being compatible with other mods. There are limitations to this compatibility however as changing zombie sounds using .bank files or textures etc might render the mod incompatible with other Zomboid Forge addons.

At the end of the day, it's your creativity that matters and my framework is mostly here to give tools to modders for easy implementation of zombies by utilizing an optimized framework which handles all the stats of zombies and when to trigger specific updates to the zombies.

A template will be provided that you can follow along or modify in real time with your own custom zombies. Small tricks and examples of what you can do will be shown too.
